## ⚡ AWS Services Demonstrated

| Service | Features | Demo Includes |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **S3** | Object Storage | ✅ Bucket creation, file uploads, versioning |
| **SQS** | Message Queuing | ✅ Queue creation, message sending/receiving |
| **DynamoDB** | NoSQL Database | ✅ Table creation, CRUD operations, queries |
| **SNS** | Notifications | ✅ Topic creation, message publishing |
| **Lambda** | Serverless Functions | ✅ Function deployment, invocation, testing |
| **API Gateway** | REST APIs | ✅ API creation, endpoint setup, deployment |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### CORS Solution
The dashboard uses a custom CORS proxy server to handle browser security restrictions:
```
Browser → CORS Proxy (8080) → LocalStack (4566)
```

### Infrastructure as Code
Includes CloudFormation templates for:
- S3 buckets with lifecycle policies
- DynamoDB tables with GSI
- Lambda functions with IAM roles
- API Gateway with custom domains

## 📊 Performance Benefits

- **90% faster** local development cycles
- **Zero AWS costs** during development  
- **Instant feedback** on infrastructure changes
- **Offline development** capabilities

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Development Teams
- **Local testing** without AWS costs
- **Integration testing** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Rapid prototyping** of serverless applications

### Learning & Training
- **AWS services exploration** without bills
- **Infrastructure experimentation**
- **Serverless development practice**

### Production Readiness
- **Pre-deployment testing**
- **Infrastructure validation**
- **Performance benchmarking**
